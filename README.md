# Project #1: Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview:

This project is a demonstration of my ability to use HTML, CSS and JS to build a familiar game with my own twist!




## Technical Requirements

Your Tic Tac Toe app must:
- Game board renders in the browser
- Game switches turns between X and O
- Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row, or show a draw if neither player wins
- Game is deployed to Github pages


### User Stories
- As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
- As a user, I should be able to selct X or O
- As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
- As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
- As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page
